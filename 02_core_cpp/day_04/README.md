# Day 04: Basic Classes

## Learning Objectives

- Define classes with member variables and functions
- Understand access specifiers: public, private, protected
- Learn constructor basics
- Practice encapsulation

## C++ Concepts

- **class vs struct**: class has private by default, struct public
- **Access specifiers**: `public:`, `private:`, `protected:`
- **Member functions**: Functions defined inside the class
- **Constructor**: Special function called on object creation
- **this pointer**: Pointer to current object instance
- **Getter/Setter pattern**: Controlled access to private members

## Math Concepts

- **2D Vectors**: Mathematical vectors with x, y components
- **Vector operations**: Addition, subtraction, scaling, dot product
- **Magnitude and normalization**: Length and unit vectors

## Your Task

Implement classes representing mathematical concepts:
1. Vector2D class with operations
2. Counter class demonstrating encapsulation
3. Use constructors and access specifiers properly

## Files to Implement

- `src/vector2d.cpp` — implement Vector2D methods
- `src/counter.cpp` — implement Counter methods
- `src/main.cpp` — test both classes
