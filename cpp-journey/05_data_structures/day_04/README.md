# Day 04: TypeScript CLI Integration

Build a TypeScript CLI tool that uses C++ data structures via Node.js bindings.

## Architecture
- `cpp/` - Data structures library
- `ts/` - CLI tool using containers

## Tasks
1. Build C++ containers as shared library with C exports
2. Create TypeScript bindings
3. Build CLI for data storage/retrieval
