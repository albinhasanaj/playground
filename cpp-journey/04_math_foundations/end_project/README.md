# Level 04 End Project: Linear Algebra Library

Complete linear algebra library with Python Jupyter notebook demos.

## Architecture
- `cpp/` - Full linear algebra C++ library
- `python/notebook.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook demonstrating concepts
- `python/tests/` - Correctness tests

## Features
1. Matrix operations (any size)
2. LU decomposition
3. Eigenvalue computation (power iteration)
4. Linear system solving
5. Least squares
